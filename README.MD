# GUI Sensors

I think that a lot of Linux users like to check their CPU sensors, but a lot of them just type 'sensors' inside CLI. I was doing the same thing for a very long time, but then I decided that I want to turn this simple command into a full GUI app. Inside this app you have fully the same functionality, but it automatically updates every second and also shows your CPU usage in percents.

**Note: This app is only for Linux and probably MacOS, so even not try to run her on Windows.**

# To-Do

- [ ] **Minimze usage of CPU, RAM, etc:** To show a real results and not affect perfomance in any way we should make this app veeery minimalistic. We have to clean code and remove from him as much as we can.
- [ ] **Dark Theme:** Just add a black mode to make it more comfortable for eyes if user have to check his CPU temperature at night.
